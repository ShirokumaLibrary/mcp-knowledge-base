# TypeScript Any Type Elimination Project (2025-01)

This directory contains documentation from the TypeScript `any` type elimination project.

## Overview

A focused effort to improve type safety by eliminating all uses of the `any` type in the codebase.

## Documents

- Analysis reports tracking `any` type usage
- Migration examples and patterns
- Security-specific type fixes
- Weekly progress reports

## Results

- **Start**: 249 `any` types
- **End**: 0 `any` types
- **Impact**: Significantly improved type safety and caught several potential bugs

## Key Achievements

1. Proper typing for all database operations
2. Strongly typed MCP protocol handlers
3. Type-safe error handling
4. Improved IDE support and autocomplete

## Lessons Learned

- Gradual migration is more sustainable than big-bang approach
- Focus on critical paths first (handlers, repositories)
- Use TypeScript's utility types effectively
- Document intentional `any` usage with `@ai-any-deliberate`
