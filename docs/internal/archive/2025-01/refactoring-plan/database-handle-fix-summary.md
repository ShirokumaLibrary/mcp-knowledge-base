# Database Handle Fix Summary

## Problem
Tests were experiencing intermittent "SQLITE_MISUSE: Database handle is closed" errors, preventing CI/CD automation. The errors occurred randomly in different tests on each run.

## Root Cause
- Test isolation issues - database connections were being shared or closed prematurely between tests
- Improper database lifecycle management in test setup/teardown
- Tests creating database instances directly without proper cleanup

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created Test Database Helper
Created `/src/test-utils/database-test-helper.ts` with:
- `createTestDatabase()` - Factory function that creates isolated database instances
- Automatic cleanup tracking with unique IDs
- `closeAllTestDatabases()` - Global cleanup for orphaned connections
- Better error handling during cleanup

### 2. Updated Database Connection Class
Modified `/src/database/base.ts`:
- Improved `close()` method to handle errors gracefully
- Clear internal state before closing
- Don't reject on close errors to avoid hanging tests

### 3. Updated FileIssueDatabase
Modified `/src/database/index.ts`:
- Made `close()` method more resilient with try-catch
- Log errors but don't throw during cleanup

### 4. Migrated Tests to Use Helper
Updated problematic test files:
- `/src/__tests__/status-filtering.test.ts`
- `/src/__tests__/error-handling.test.ts`
- Replaced direct database creation with `createTestDatabase()`
- Proper cleanup with `context.cleanup()` in afterEach

### 5. Jest Configuration Updates
- Already had `maxWorkers: 1` to prevent parallel execution
- Removed global database cleanup from `jest.setup.ts` to avoid import issues

## Results
- All tests now pass consistently
- No more "Database handle is closed" errors
- Tests are properly isolated with unique temp directories
- Ready for CI/CD automation

## Best Practices for Future Tests
1. Always use `createTestDatabase()` helper instead of creating databases directly
2. Always call `context.cleanup()` in afterEach
3. Use unique prefixes for test databases to aid debugging
4. Don't share database instances between test suites

## Technical Details
- Each test gets a unique database in OS temp directory
- Database IDs include: prefix, process ID, counter, and timestamp
- Cleanup is best-effort - errors are logged but don't fail tests
- Small delay added after close to ensure database is fully closed
