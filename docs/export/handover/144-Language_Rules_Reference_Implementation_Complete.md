# Language Rules Reference Implementation

## Summary
Applied language rules references to all command and agent files in the SHIROKUMA ecosystem to ensure consistent language handling across the system.

## Changes Made

### Command Files Updated (24 files)
All command files in `.shirokuma/commands/` now reference the language rules file:

**Main Commands:**
- commit.md
- create-command.md
- go.md
- finish.md
- start.md
- issue.md
- security-review.md
- spec.md
- vibe.md

**Spec Subcommands (10 files):**
- spec/check.md
- spec/tasks.md
- spec/req.md
- spec/micro.md
- spec/quick.md
- spec/when.md
- spec/steering.md (special handling for existing language section)
- spec/design.md
- spec/refine.md
- spec/validate.md

**Vibe Subcommands (5 files):**
- vibe/commit.md
- vibe/tdd.md
- vibe/visual.md
- vibe/spec.md
- vibe/code.md

### Agent Files Updated (8 files)
All agent files in `.claude/agents/` now have Language Settings sections:

- shirokuma-system-harmonizer.md
- shirokuma-researcher.md
- shirokuma-reviewer.md
- shirokuma-methodology-keeper.md
- shirokuma-knowledge-curator.md
- shirokuma-issue-manager.md
- shirokuma-mcp-specialist.md
- mcp-api-tester.md

## Update Pattern

### For Commands
Replaced:
```markdown
## Language

Note: Language settings are configured in MCP steering documents
```

With:
```markdown
## Language

@.shirokuma/commands/shared/lang.markdown
```

### For Agents
Added after the agent's main description:
```markdown
## Language Settings

@.shirokuma/commands/shared/lang.markdown
```

## Verification
- All files now reference the centralized language rules at `.shirokuma/commands/shared/lang.markdown`
- The reference uses the `@` syntax for file inclusion
- Preserved all other content exactly as it was
- Special handling for agents that already had Configuration sections (added Language Settings before Configuration)

## Impact
This change ensures:
1. Consistent language behavior across all commands and agents
2. Single source of truth for language rules
3. Easy maintenance - updating the lang.markdown file will affect all components
4. Clear separation between language rules and other configurations
