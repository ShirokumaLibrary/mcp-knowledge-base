# Release Notes v0.4.2

**Release Date**: 2025-07-29

## 🎉 Highlights

This release focuses on **critical security improvements** and **comprehensive testing** to ensure system stability and reliability.

## 🔒 Security

### Path Traversal Vulnerability Fix

We discovered and fixed a critical security vulnerability where malicious session IDs could create files outside the data directory.

**Impact**: Users could potentially access or create files in unauthorized locations using specially crafted IDs like `../../etc/passwd`.

**Fix**: Implemented multi-layer defense:
1. **Zod Schema Validation**: Input validation at the API level
2. **Repository Validation**: Path validation in SessionManager and BaseRepository
3. **Core Path Validation**: Final validation in ItemRepository's getFilePath method

**Validation Rules**:
- Blocks path traversal patterns: `..`, `/`, `\`, null bytes
- Blocks absolute paths
- Only allows alphanumeric characters, hyphens, underscores, and dots
- Validates at multiple layers for defense in depth

## ✨ New Features

### Comprehensive Monkey Testing

Added extensive stress testing with edge cases to ensure system robustness:

- **Unicode and Emoji Handling**: Verified proper handling of 🎉, 😀, and other Unicode characters
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Tested against common attack patterns
- **Concurrent Operations**: Verified thread-safety and data consistency
- **Large Dataset Handling**: Successfully tested with 50+ tags per item
- **Custom Type Validation**: Ensured dynamic type system works correctly

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

- Fixed security vulnerability where malicious session IDs could create files outside data directory
- Enhanced input validation across all ID parameters
- Improved error messages for invalid input formats

## 📚 Documentation

### Complete Documentation Reorganization

We've completely restructured our documentation for better organization and accessibility:

**New Structure**:
- **`docs/user/`** - User-facing documentation (quickstart, installation, usage, API reference)
- **`docs/developer/`** - Developer resources (architecture, database design, contribution guide)
- **`docs/internal/`** - Internal project documentation (testing guides, AI annotations)
- **`docs/releases/`** - Release notes and migration guides
- **`docs/ja/`** - Japanese documentation mirroring the above structure

**Improvements**:
- Clear separation between user and developer documentation
- Comprehensive navigation READMEs in each directory
- New user guides: quickstart, installation guide, usage examples
- New developer guides: database design, API architecture, debugging guide
- Backward compatibility with redirect files for old paths
- Removed obsolete `docs.ja/` directory
- Better documentation discoverability

## 📊 Testing Coverage

Continued improvements from v0.4.1:
- Function coverage: 80.33%
- 500+ tests across the codebase
- Comprehensive security layer tests
- MCP protocol test suite with 200+ test cases

## 🔄 Migration

No migration required from v0.4.1. Simply update and restart the server.
