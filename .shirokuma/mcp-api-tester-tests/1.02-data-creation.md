## Notes
- Priority values: CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW, MINIMAL
- Status values: Open, Specification, Waiting, Ready, In Progress, Review, Testing, Pending, Completed, Closed, Canceled, Rejected
- All ID references should be numeric (not string-based like "issues-1")
- The `type` field should be singular (e.g., "issue" not "issues")
