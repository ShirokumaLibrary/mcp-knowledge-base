# /kuma:spec:design - Design Phase Command

## Language

@.shirokuma/commands/shared/lang.markdown

## Purpose

Creates comprehensive technical design documents based on requirements. This is Phase 2 of the spec-driven development process.

## Usage

```bash
/kuma:spec:design <spec-id>           # Generate design from requirements
/kuma:spec:design refine <spec-id>    # Refine existing design
/kuma:spec:design validate <spec-id>  # Validate design quality
```

## Implementation

**Type used**: `type: "spec_design"` - Design phase only (architecture, data models, interfaces)

### Design Generation Process

#### Step 1: Load Requirements
- Retrieve spec from MCP
- Parse requirements document
- Extract functional and non-functional requirements
- Identify integration points

#### Step 2: Architecture Design
- Define system context
- Create high-level architecture
- Identify components and relationships
- Choose technology stack with rationale

#### Step 3: Component Design
- Define component responsibilities
- Specify interfaces (input/output)
- Document dependencies
- Add implementation notes

#### Step 4: Data Model Design
- Create entity definitions
- Define relationships
- Add validation rules
- Design data flow

#### Step 5: API Design
- Define endpoints
- Specify request/response schemas
- Document error responses
- Add authentication/authorization

### Generation Prompt

From @.shirokuma/commands/shared/spec-prompts.markdown:

```
Based on the requirements we've established, I need a comprehensive design for [FEATURE_NAME].

Requirements summary: [KEY_REQUIREMENTS_FROM_SPEC]

Please create a design that addresses:
- Overall architecture and component relationships
- Data models and their relationships
- API interfaces and contracts
- Error handling strategies
- Testing approach

Consider these technical constraints:
- Technology stack: [CURRENT_TECH_STACK]
- Performance requirements: [FROM_REQUIREMENTS]
- Integration points: [FROM_REQUIREMENTS]

Generate a design document following this structure:
[Template from @.shirokuma/commands/shared/spec-templates.markdown#design-template-structure]
```

```

### Design Refinement

```yaml
# Design Refinement Process
1. Retrieve Current Design:
   - Tool: mcp__shirokuma-kb__get_item
     Parameters:
       id: spec-id
     Purpose: Get existing design spec

2. Analyze Refinement Needs:
   - Review user feedback or requirements changes
   - Identify specific areas needing updates
   - Plan refinement strategy

3. Apply Design Updates:
   - Update architecture components as needed
   - Modify API specifications
   - Adjust data models and relationships
   - Update technology choices with rationale

4. Update Specification:
   - Tool: mcp__shirokuma-kb__update_item
     Parameters:
       id: spec-id
       content: refined-design-content
     Purpose: Save refined design

5. Version Management:
   - Increment version number
   - Update timestamp
   - Document refinement rationale
```

### Design Validation

Validation checklist:
- [ ] All requirements addressed
- [ ] Architecture is clear and logical
- [ ] Components have defined interfaces
- [ ] Data models are complete
- [ ] API contracts are consistent
- [ ] Error handling is comprehensive
- [ ] Security is properly addressed
- [ ] Performance considerations included
- [ ] Testing approach defined

## Examples

### Generate Design from Requirements
```
User: /kuma:spec:design 101
Assistant:
1. Retrieves requirements from spec #101
2. Analyzes functional requirements
3. Creates architecture based on constraints
4. Designs components and interfaces
5. Defines data models and API
6. Updates spec with design phase
7. Returns: "âœ… Design saved to shirokuma-kb with ID: 107"
```

### Refine Design
```
User: /kuma:spec:design refine 101
Assistant:
1. Retrieves design from spec #101
2. Asks what needs refinement
3. Updates specific components
4. Maintains design coherence
5. Documents decision changes
```

### Validate Design
```
User: /kuma:spec:design validate 101
Assistant:
1. Retrieves design from spec #101
2. Checks against requirements
3. Validates completeness
4. Reports gaps or issues
5. Suggests improvements
```

## Design Principles

### Architecture Guidelines
- **Modularity**: Loosely coupled components
- **Scalability**: Design for growth
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns
- **Testability**: Design for testing
- **Security**: Defense in depth

### Technology Selection
- Choose boring technology (proven solutions)
- Consider team expertise
- Evaluate maintenance burden
- Assess community support
- Document rationale

### API Design Best Practices
- RESTful conventions
- Consistent naming
- Proper status codes
- Comprehensive error messages
- Versioning strategy

## Next Phase

After design is approved:
- Use `/kuma:spec:tasks` to create implementation plan
- Or use `/kuma:spec` to continue with all phases
