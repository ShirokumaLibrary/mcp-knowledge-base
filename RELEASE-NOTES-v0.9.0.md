# Release Notes - SHIROKUMA Knowledge Base v0.9.0

Release Date: 2025-08-23

## üéØ Overview

Version 0.9.0 represents a major milestone in the SHIROKUMA Knowledge Base evolution, focusing on system consistency, code quality improvements, and architectural refinements. This release achieves a harmony score of 0.96/1.00, marking significant progress toward the 1.0 release.

## ‚ú® Major Changes

### 1. TypeScript Code Elimination
- **Removed all TypeScript/JavaScript code** from 18 specification files
- **Converted to declarative YAML/Markdown** format for better clarity
- **Improved AI readability** and maintainability
- **Files affected**: 15 command files, 3 agent files

### 2. Language Rules Centralization
- **Created unified language configuration** at `.shirokuma/commands/shared/lang.markdown`
- **Consistent language usage** across all components:
  - Japanese for user interactions
  - English for code, commits, and technical elements
- **Applied to all 32 files** in the system

### 3. Directory Structure Reorganization
- **Moved commands** to `.shirokuma/commands/kuma/` for namespace clarity
- **Updated symlinks** to maintain compatibility
- **Better organization** of spec and vibe subcommands

### 4. Output Style Implementation
- **New spec-driven development mode** in `.claude/output-styles/`
- **Three-phase workflow enforcement**: Requirements ‚Üí Design ‚Üí Tasks
- **Approval gates** prevent premature implementation

### 5. MCP API Standardization
- **Unified naming convention**: `mcp__shirokuma-kb__*` format
- **Updated all test cases** to current specification
- **Consistent API usage** throughout the system

## üîß Technical Improvements

### Code Quality
- Elimination of executable code from specification files
- Pure declarative specifications using YAML/Markdown
- Improved separation of concerns

### Documentation
- Comprehensive conversion rules documentation
- TypeScript detection script for validation
- Updated all agent and command specifications

### Testing Strategy
- Acknowledgment of STDIO connection testing limitations
- Shift to user review-based quality assurance
- Manual test checklist creation

## üìä Metrics

- **Harmony Score**: 0.96/1.00 (up from 0.90)
- **Files Modified**: 38
- **TypeScript Code Removed**: ~1,355 lines
- **YAML/Markdown Added**: ~1,217 lines
- **Test Coverage**: Partial (environment-dependent issues)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations

### Testing Constraints
- **Custom commands** (`/kuma:*`) cannot be automatically tested
- **Sub-agents** only function within Claude CLI environment
- **Quality assurance** relies on user review and real-world usage

### Pending Issues
- Some unit tests fail due to environment configuration
- Complete test automation not feasible for STDIO-based MCP
- Minor language mixing in some documentation

## üîÑ Migration Guide

### For Users
1. No breaking changes in command usage
2. All commands function identically
3. Improved error messages and clarity

### For Developers
1. Review new YAML/Markdown specification format
2. Use explicit MCP tool names: `mcp__shirokuma-kb__*`
3. Follow centralized language rules in `lang.markdown`
4. Refer to `scripts/conversion-rules.md` for patterns

## üöÄ What's Next

### Short-term (v0.9.1)
- Fix environment-dependent test issues
- Complete language unification in documentation
- Implement alternative testing strategies

### Medium-term (v0.9.5)
- Performance optimizations
- Enhanced error handling patterns
- Automated validation tools

### Long-term (v1.0.0)
- Achieve harmony score 1.00
- Complete automation pipeline
- Full test coverage where feasible
