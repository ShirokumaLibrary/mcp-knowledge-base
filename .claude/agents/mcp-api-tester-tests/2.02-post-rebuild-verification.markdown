# Test Case 2.02: Post-Rebuild API Verification

**Prerequisites**: 
- Test Case 2.01 (Database Rebuild) must be completed
- For standard rebuild: Connection is preserved, proceed immediately
- For forced clean rebuild: May need server restart if database was deleted while connected

If fails: Request server restart
If succeeds: Proceed with verification
```
