description: Commit changes following project guidelines and handle releases

## Context

- Current git status: !`git status`
- Current git diff (staged and unstaged changes): !`git diff HEAD`
- Current branch: !`git branch --show-current`
- Recent commits: !`git log --oneline -5`

## Task

@.claude/agents/LANG.markdown

<ultrathink>
I need to:
1. Run all tests first to ensure nothing is broken
2. If tests fail, stop the commit process immediately
3. If tests pass, analyze the current git status and diff
4. Commit changes in the proper order: source code, tests, distribution files, and documentation
5. Ensure no AI references are included in commit messages
</ultrathink>

### Pre-commit Check

**CRITICAL: Run all tests before committing**

```bash
npm test
```

**If tests fail:**
- ‚ùå STOP immediately - do not proceed with commits
- üîç Show the failing test output to the user
- üìù Ask if they want to fix the issues first

**If all tests pass:**
- ‚úÖ Continue with commit process

Execute conventional commits in this specific order:

### 1. Source Code
```bash
git add src/ --exclude='*.test.ts' --exclude='*.spec.ts' --exclude='__tests__'
git add package.json tsconfig.json
```

### 2. Test Code
```bash
git add src/**/*.test.ts src/**/*.spec.ts src/__tests__/
```

### 3. Distribution Files  
```bash
npm run build  # MUST use production build, not dev
git add dist/
```

### 4. Documentation
```bash
git add docs/ *.md
```

## Critical Rules

1. **Always run tests before committing** - if tests fail, STOP immediately
2. **Never include AI references in commits** (no "generated by", "created with AI", etc.)
3. **Always use production build** for dist/ (excludes tests, maps, .d.ts)
4. **Semantic versioning**: patch=fixes, minor=features, major=breaking

## Version Release

<ultrathink>
If a version release is requested, I need to:
1. Determine if this is a patch, minor, or major version bump based on the changes
2. Update the CHANGELOG.md with the new version
3. Use npm version to create the release commit and tag
4. Push the changes and publish to npm
</ultrathink>

When requested (e.g., "bump version by 0.0.1"):

1. Update CHANGELOG.md (move [Unreleased] to new version)
2. `git commit -m "docs: update CHANGELOG for vX.X.X"`
3. `npm version patch/minor/major -m "chore: release v%s"`
4. `git push && git push --tags`
5. `npm publish`

## CHANGELOG Format

```markdown
## [Unreleased]
### Added/Changed/Fixed

## [0.0.9] - 2024-01-15
### Added
- User-facing feature description
```

Focus on user impact, not implementation details.
