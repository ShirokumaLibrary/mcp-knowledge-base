# Test Case 2: Database Rebuild Tests

Test database reconstruction from markdown files. **MUST BE RUN LAST**.

## 2.1 Pre-Rebuild Phase

### 2.1.1 Database Backup
```
Bash: cp .shirokuma/data/search.db .shirokuma/data/search.db.backup
Expected: Database file copied successfully
```

### 2.1.2 Record Current State
```
Tool: get_items
Parameters: {type: "issues", includeClosedStatuses: true}
Note: Record count and IDs

Tool: get_tags
Note: Record all tags

Tool: get_types
Note: Record custom types
```

## 2.2 Rebuild Execution

### 2.2.1 Execute Rebuild

```
Bash: MCP_DATABASE_PATH=.shirokuma/data npm run rebuild-db
Expected: 
- "Starting database rebuild..."
- "Database rebuilt successfully"
- Count of items processed
```

### 2.2.2 Restart MCP Server
```
Note: MCP server must be restarted to use the rebuilt database
Action: Stop and restart the MCP server connection
```

## 2.3 Post-Rebuild Verification

### 2.3.1 Basic Item Verification

```
Tool: get_items
Parameters: {type: "issues", includeClosedStatuses: true}
Expected: Same count as pre-rebuild
```

### 2.3.2 Tag Verification
```
Tool: get_tags
Expected: All tags from markdown files
Note: Deleted tags should not reappear
```

### 2.3.3 Type Verification
```
Tool: get_types
Expected: Custom types preserved
```

### 2.3.4 Content Integrity Check
```
Tool: get_item_detail
Parameters: {type: "issues", id: 1}
Expected: 
- Multi-line content preserved
- Unicode characters intact
- All fields match original
```

### 2.3.5 Session Verification
```
Tool: get_items
Parameters: {type: "sessions"}
Expected: All sessions restored with correct timestamps
```

### 2.3.6 Daily Summary Verification
```
Tool: get_items
Parameters: {type: "dailies"}
Expected: All daily summaries restored
```

## 2.4 Sequence and ID Verification

### 2.4.1 Check ID Sequences

```
Tool: create_item
Parameters: {
  type: "issues",
  title: "Post-Rebuild Issue",
  content: "Testing ID sequence",
  priority: "low",
  status: "Open"
}
Expected: Next sequential ID (not duplicate)
```

### 2.4.2 Verify Special Type Sequences
```
Note: Sessions and dailies should maintain sequence value of 0
```

## 2.5 Search Index Verification

### 2.5.1 Full-text Search Test

```
Tool: search_items
Parameters: {query: "authentication"}
Expected: Same results as before rebuild
```

### 2.5.2 Tag Search Test
```
Tool: search_items_by_tag
Parameters: {tag: "bug"}
Expected: Same items as before rebuild
```

## 2.6 Database Comparison

### 2.6.1 File System Comparison

```
Bash: ls -la .shirokuma/data/search.db*
Expected: Both search.db and search.db.backup exist
```

### 2.6.2 File Size Comparison
```
Bash: du -h .shirokuma/data/search.db .shirokuma/data/search.db.backup
Expected: Sizes may differ slightly due to vacuum/optimization
```

### 2.6.3 Schema Comparison
```
Bash: sqlite3 .shirokuma/data/search.db ".schema" > /tmp/schema_new.sql
Bash: sqlite3 .shirokuma/data/search.db.backup ".schema" > /tmp/schema_old.sql  
Bash: diff /tmp/schema_old.sql /tmp/schema_new.sql
Expected: No differences in schema
```

### 2.6.4 Record Count Comparison
```
Bash: sqlite3 .shirokuma/data/search.db "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM items;"
Bash: sqlite3 .shirokuma/data/search.db.backup "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM items;"
Expected: New DB may have fewer items (deleted items not restored)
```

### Detailed Record Comparison
```
# Count by type
Bash: sqlite3 .shirokuma/data/search.db "SELECT type, COUNT(*) FROM items GROUP BY type ORDER BY type;"
Bash: sqlite3 .shirokuma/data/search.db.backup "SELECT type, COUNT(*) FROM items GROUP BY type ORDER BY type;"

# List all item IDs for comparison
Bash: sqlite3 .shirokuma/data/search.db "SELECT type || '-' || id FROM items ORDER BY type, CAST(id AS INTEGER);" > /tmp/items_new.txt
Bash: sqlite3 .shirokuma/data/search.db.backup "SELECT type || '-' || id FROM items ORDER BY type, CAST(id AS INTEGER);" > /tmp/items_old.txt
Bash: diff /tmp/items_old.txt /tmp/items_new.txt
Expected: Only deleted items should be missing
```

### Verify Sequences
```
Bash: sqlite3 .shirokuma/data/search.db "SELECT * FROM sequences ORDER BY type;"
Expected: All sequences preserved with correct values

# Compare sequences between databases
Bash: sqlite3 .shirokuma/data/search.db "SELECT type, sequence, base_type FROM sequences ORDER BY type;" > /tmp/seq_new.txt
Bash: sqlite3 .shirokuma/data/search.db.backup "SELECT type, sequence, base_type FROM sequences ORDER BY type;" > /tmp/seq_old.txt
Bash: diff /tmp/seq_old.txt /tmp/seq_new.txt
Expected: No differences (sequences should match)
```

### Tag Comparison
```
# Count tags
Bash: sqlite3 .shirokuma/data/search.db "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tags;"
Bash: sqlite3 .shirokuma/data/search.db.backup "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tags;"

# List all tags
Bash: sqlite3 .shirokuma/data/search.db "SELECT name FROM tags ORDER BY name;" > /tmp/tags_new.txt
Bash: sqlite3 .shirokuma/data/search.db.backup "SELECT name FROM tags ORDER BY name;" > /tmp/tags_old.txt
Bash: diff /tmp/tags_old.txt /tmp/tags_new.txt
Expected: Deleted tags should not reappear
```

### Search Index Comparison
```
# Check FTS table
Bash: sqlite3 .shirokuma/data/search.db "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM items_fts;"
Bash: sqlite3 .shirokuma/data/search.db.backup "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM items_fts;"
Expected: Should match items table count
```

## 2.7 Test Completion

### 2.7.1 SQLite Verification Summary
```
Status: Database rebuild and SQLite-level verification complete
Next Step: Server restart required for API testing
Note: Continue with Test Case 2.02 after server restart
```

## Important Notes

- Rebuild reads all markdown files and recreates database
- Deleted items are not restored (only exists in DB)
- Tag associations are rebuilt from markdown
- Search indexes are recreated
- Custom types must exist in sequences table
- Sessions use timestamp IDs (not sequential)
- Dailies use date IDs (not sequential)
- Backup allows rollback if rebuild fails
- Server restart is REQUIRED after rebuild for changes to take effect
