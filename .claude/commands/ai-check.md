# ai-check - Current Work Status Check

## Usage
```
/ai-check
```

## Task

**Check your current work status - like checking your notes with memory disorder**

### 1. Get Current State
Execute: `mcp__shirokuma-knowledge-base__get_current_state()`

Display summary:
```
## üìç Current State
[Show first 10 lines of current_state]
...
```

### 2. Check Active Session
Get current time: !`date +"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"`

Search for active session in current_state.
If found, calculate elapsed time.

```
## ‚è±Ô∏è Active Session
- Session: [session-id]
- Started: [time] ([elapsed] ago)
- Working on: [issue-id]
```

### 3. Recent Records (Memory Bank Check)
Get current datetime and calculate 1 hour ago.

**Check Memory Bank records**:

Calculate one hour ago in ISO datetime format.

Execute these in parallel:
- `mcp__shirokuma-knowledge-base__get_items` with type: "decisions", start_date: (one hour ago)
- `mcp__shirokuma-knowledge-base__get_items` with type: "issues", start_date: (one hour ago)
- `mcp__shirokuma-knowledge-base__get_items` with type: "knowledge", start_date: (one hour ago)

These results form your Memory Bank - what you've recorded.
